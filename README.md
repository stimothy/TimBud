## **<p align="center">A Distributed Budgeting System</p>**

TimBud is a distributed budgeting system that allows users to connect to and collaborate on different budgets with other users. Each budget allows users to enter in a new budget category and fill out how much they have alloted to spend on that category for their budget. The budget also allows users to enter in how much they have spent so far.

* For a detailed report of this system see the [update this later](https://github.com/stimothy/TimBud).

## Acknowledgments

TimBud was created using code ideas pulled from a group project [BudgetPro](https://github.com/JayBradshaw/BudgetPro.git) created by: 
* [Steven Timothy](https://github.com/stimothy)
* [Justin Bradshaw](https://github.com/JayBradshaw)
* [Jeff Heilbut](https://github.com/JeffreyGene)

The inspiration of this project was to create a budgeting system that allows different users in different locations to collaborate on the same budget.
